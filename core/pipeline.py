# In order to get multiple outputs on one video several steps are required:
# 1.Split the video into smaller segments using ffmpeg or any similar application.
# 2.Create a pipeline for each model
# 3.Run each model for which you want to perform identification for on separate threads using parallel processing
# 4.Combine the segments of the videos based on any metric, for example, timestamps
# 5.Merge the smaller segments of the video into a larger one using ffmpeg
# 6.Once the frames are merged, you will need to encode the video to create the final output. Utilize the video encoding capabilities of ffmpeg.
